            <p class="normal-text">Do you know how many satellites orbit our planet? Do you know which is the real
                objective of the most of them? There are a lot of questions about these objects that are so important
                for some activities of human life and, because of this, we brought some super interesting curiosites to
                you stay on top of this subject!
                Today, there are about 4000 satellites orbiting the Earth. Most of them are primarily intended for
                communication in many places around the world, but they also have other features, like weather
                forecasts, surveys and even for military use.

            <h3 class="subtitle-text"> The importance of satellites:
            </h3>
            <p class="normal-text">It may seem like something distant, but the satellites are very important for the
                everyday life of the human being. They are the most responsible for the dissemination of information
                from around the world, making communication between people in distant places of the globe faster and
                more practical.
                Among their main functionalities, they are responsible for analyzing and promoting a climate prediction
                in many parts of the world, making measurements of natural resources, and recording and informing the
                effects on the planet caused by humans.
                Beside that, many countries use satellites for military purposes. A good example of this can be seen in
                the famous Cold War, in which several satellites were created and launched in demand of conquering the
                space.

            <h3 class="subtitle-text">Space Garbage:</h3>
            <p class="normal-text">Despite all the advantages and efficiency offered by satellites orbiting our planet,
                they suffer from a serious problem: the presence of a lot of orbiting space debris.
                Space debris orbiting the Earth is mostly from satellite wreckage, since it comes from testing, faulty
                satellites or even space missions. It is estimated today the presence of 150,000 wrecks orbiting our
                planet. Due to this large amount, they can cause huge damage by crashing into active satellites and
                disrupting their operation or even destroying them.
                Have you ever wondered what would happen if the world's leading communication satellites were destroyed?
                How would we stand days waiting for their replacement? Yeah, It’s surreal. Unfortunately, we are subject
                to this kind of situation. Although satellites are placed on less polluted routes, they are still in
                serious danger of damage, which is why we should be a little more concerned about the space scrap metal
                emission.
                Even though it seems a little distant from most people's reality, we should start worrying about this
                issue early on, in order to form citizens who are more aware and concerned about our planet.
